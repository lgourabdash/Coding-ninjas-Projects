# 🚀 Java Full Stack Web Development Project

This repository contains all the files and projects I built during my **Java Full Stack Web Development** training at **Coding Ninjas**.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of **front-end** and **API integration** concepts using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and a **dummy JSON API** for data handling.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend / API:** Dummy JSON (Simulated REST API)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Fully responsive user interface built with HTML & CSS
- Dynamic content rendering using JavaScript
- API data fetched from a local `dummy.json` file
- Modular and reusable code structure
- Version-controlled with Git for collaborative workflow

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Structuring a full-stack web project
- DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript
- Fetching and displaying API data dynamically
- Managing code with Git & GitHub
- Writing clean, maintainable, and responsive front-end code
